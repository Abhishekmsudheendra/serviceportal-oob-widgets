## Enhance or Expand Features and Functionality

OOB Widgets are `READ ONLY` so you can benefit from future updates. Edit and extend a widget's functionality; you need to clone it first in order to take advantage of existing code.

View production documentation ['Clone a Widget'](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/istanbul-servicenow-platform/page/build/service-portal/task/t_CloneAndEditAWidget.html) to learn more.
